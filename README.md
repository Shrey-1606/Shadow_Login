Shadow_Login is a Python-based GUI authentication system built using Tkinter, featuring secure encrypted credential storage, role-based access control (Admin/User), and a fully interactive interface.

This project demonstrates how traditional login systems can be enhanced with custom encryption, file-based secure storage, and admin-level management, all wrapped in a modern GUI.
